I take no credit for building these vehicles I just assemble them how I prefer and occasionally clear some errors. The actual credit goes to the following:

TorkModding,MdkMods for their excellent Landcruiser model.

The Expendables for their wheel and acessories models from their excellent Lancruiser.
